##Description
.A simple program written in c to make a linked list and try to implement it. By printing the 
nodes present we confirm how the nodes are arranged in a linked list. We are also able to depict 
the relationship between each node, as seen in the way they are arranged in the console
screen

##functions
.Define structure of the node
.create new node
.print values held by the nodes
.main function

##Objective
.Make a linked list using code
.Access individual nodes
.Memory allocation to newly made nodes
.print the components of the linked list

##inputs
.pass node values in create function

##output
.nodes as arranged in the list
